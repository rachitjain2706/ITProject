## Case Study â€“ Medicine Shop Software (MSS):

A medicine shop has approached us to develop the following software to
automate various book-keeping activities associated with the business. A retail
medicine shop deals with a large number of medicines procured from various
manufacturers. The shop owner maintains different medicines in wall mounted
and numbered racks. The shop owner maintains as small as inventory for each
item as is reasonable, from the point of view of reducing inventory overheads.
Thus, one important problem the shop owner faces is to be able to order items
as soon as the number of items in the inventory reduces below a threshold
value. The shop owner wants to maintain medicines to be able to sustain selling
for about one week. To calculate the threshold value for each item, the software
must be able to calculate the average number of medicines sales for one week
for each part. At the end of each day, the shop owner would request the
computer to generate the items to be ordered. The computer should print out the
medicine description, the quantity required, and the address of the vendor
supplying the medicine. The shop owner should be able to store the name,
address and the code number of the medicine that each vendor deals with. At
the end of every day the shop owner would give a command to generate the list
of medicines which have expired. It should also prepare a vendor-wise list of
the expired items so that the shop owner can ask the vendor to replace these
items. Currently, this activity alone takes a tremendous amount of labour on the
part of the shop owner and is a major motivator for the automation endeavour.
Whenever new supply arrives the shop owner would enter the item code,
number, quantity, batch number, expiry date and the vendor number. The
software should print out a cheque in favour of the vendor for the items
supplied.
When the shop owner procures new medicines (not dealt with earlier), he
should be able to enter the details of each medicine such as the medicine trade
name, generic name, vendors who can supply that medicine, unit selling and
purchasing price. The computer should generate a code for each new medicine
which the shop owner would paste on the rack where it is to be stored. The shop
owner should be able to query a medicine either using its generic name or the
trade name and the software should display its code number and the quantity
held in stock.
Whenever any sales occur, the shop owner would enter the code number of each
medicine and the corresponding quantity sold. The MSS should print out the
cash receipt. The computer should also generate the revenue for each day and at
the end of the month, the computer should generate a graph showing the total
sales for each day of the month and also these figures for any given medicine. It
should also show the vendor wise payments for the period.
